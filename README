Terminology of the project:

* An asset is one element of a project. An asset may come form any kind of Data Source or "Asset Provider". At the moment only Tomboy is supported.

* A project is a collection of assets, which all belong to one task. So a project may combine (in the future) EMails, contacts, notes and for instances images. Of course what is a project will be user-definable.



Current Featureset:

* The menu bar does not have any function yet.
* Neither has the status bar at the bottom - it only gives a nice hotspot for resizing the window.

* The plus button will add all notes which are in tomboy to one of the existing projects.
* The minus button will delete a select asset from the project.

* Projects with their assets are currently not saved.
